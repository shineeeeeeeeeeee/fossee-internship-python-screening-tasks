## Task Summary  

The challenge was to create an **educated, simplified AI Debugging Assistant Prompt**, which assists students in debugging Python code **without actually providing the answer**.  

The AI assistant will:  
- Diagnose malfunctioning Python code and indicate possible problems (syntax, logic, run time).  
- Give hints, descriptions, debugging tips (print statements, checking variables, use of `pdb`).  
- Ask guiding questions that lead students to problem-solving.  
- Use an encouraging, positive tone but **not** point out the correct answer.

## Reasoning Highlights  

- **Tone and Style:** Helping, welcoming, and accommodating to both novice and advanced learners.  
- **Balancing Bug Identification and Guidance:** Identifies probable sources of errors and recommends ways of debugging the code without correcting it.  
- **Evading the Solution:** The AI is not to give fixed code, but only hints and guidance.  
- **Adaptability:**  
  - **Novices** → basic explanations, support.  
  - **Intermediate learners** → specific technical hints, such as tools like `pytest` or `pdb`.
